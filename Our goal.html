<p> The reason why we are doing this, is so the animals can enjoy their life how it suppose to be. Not 
be stuck in a Tank all day and constantly do circus tricks for people who pay to see them suffer and 
homesick. Please don't think Seaworld is a educational environment for kids, get educated on the cruelty 
the animals feel after the park closes. We want them to be happy and free like how they should be.
So think twice before buying your ticket. </p>
